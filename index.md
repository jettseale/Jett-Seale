# About Me
Hi! My name is Jett Seale. Check out my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_yX7J7r7JRPsdbts7Y6QcIfE2KVaefJ/view?usp=sharing). 

### Summary
I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Oregon State University. I'm interested in full stack web and mobile application development. 

I work as a student software developer with an OSU organization called [EPICLab](https://epiclab.github.io/). I am mentored by [Dr. Anita Sarma](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~sarmaa/). Currently, I am working on developing the front end of an experimental integrated development environment using TypeScript, React, Redux, and CSS. 

In my free time I enjoy participating in hackathons with my friends, building fun games, hiking, and learning Japanese. Feel free to check out some of my work in the projects section below!

# Projects

### Senior Capstone Project: Mentory

#### Description
Mentory is an innovative online platform where users can get mentored by industry experts in real-time instead of taking asynchronous (boring) online classes. Users can browse through lists of mentors within various fields such as programming, art, business, or more. From there, they can utilize our app to schedule online meetings and develop a custom learning plan with their mentor to achieve their goals as fast as possible. Mentors can earn some extra money on the side by teaching our users online, and are able to advertise their skills and knowledge using their customizable profile page. 

This is a web application I and my team of 4 completed for our senior capstone course. The concept, design, setup, and implementation was all done from scratch over the course of 9 months. For the frontend application we used TypeScript, React, Redux, TailwindCSS, Next.js, and deployed it using Vercel. For the backend we used the headless CMS (content management system) Strapi, GraphQL, a MySQL database, and deployed the application using Heroku.

#### Highlights

#### What I Contributed & Learned
- Set up the backend application\
  I set up the headless CMS (content management system) Strapi, hooked it up to a MySQL database, and deployed it on Heroku.
  
  I learned a lot setting up the backend application for this project. I had never used Strapi or any kind of headless CMS before. I had some experience with MySQL, but I had never  
  hooked up a database before. It was also my first time deploying an application using Heroku. Getting all of the different backend tools to work together was a fun challenge! It   
  was suprisingly easy to get it to communicate with the frontend, however.

- Developed UI components\
  I developed various UI components for the project including the mentor listing filter sidebar, the sign up page, and the mentor profile page's availability calendar tab.
  
  While I had used React before, I became much more skilled with functional components and React hooks after this project. I also learned how to set up a Redux store using Redux 
  Toolkit. Finally, it was my first time styling with anything other than plain CSS. I learned how to use TailwindCSS to speed up the development process.
  
- Created sign up/sign in/log out functionality\
  I created the manual email/password sign up, sign in, and log out functionality.
  
  I learned how to store JWT's (JSON web tokens) using the user's browser cookies. It was cool to properly authenticate users like all the web applications I use every day. Finally,   
  I became skilled with asynchronous programming in TypeScript using the async/await keywords.
  
- Implemented the availability tab\
  I implemented the availability tab calendar component and booking functionality on the mentor profile page.
  
  I gained hands-on experience with the pros and cons of static vs. server side rendering. This was also the first time I fetched and mutated data from Strapi using GraphQL and  
  Apollo.

### Work Project: Synectic
Tools/technologies used: TypeScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Webpack, Electron, HTML, CSS, Jest, Enzyme, TravisCI, and React Testing Library.\
Synectic is an experimental integrated development environment Electron application. I developed multiple integral front-end system components, including a "create new card" modal and a file explorer. I have also written extensive unit and integration tests, increasing the total line coverage of the codebase by 30%.

### Hackathon Project: Amazon Alexa Study Buddy
Tools/technologies used: JavaScript, React, AWS, Amazon Alexa, HTML, CSS.\
Amazon Alexa Study Buddy is a web application that allows the user to create their own custom flashcards. It then can connect to an Amazon Alexa to quiz the user out-loud, using the flashcards they entered on the site. I developed the entire front-end of the website, as well as assisted in programming the Amazon Alexa.

### Personal Project: 3D Platformer Game
Tools/technologies used: Python and Godot.\
In my free time, I developed a 3D platformer game similar to Super Monkey Ball. Players can tilt various 3D platforms to try and roll a ball into the goal without the ball falling off the edges. I created all the assets, designed the levels, and programmed the game myself.
