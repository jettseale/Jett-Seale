## About Me
Hi! My name is Jett Seale. Check out my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_yX7J7r7JRPsdbts7Y6QcIfE2KVaefJ/view?usp=sharing). 

#### Summary
I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Oregon State University. I'm interested in full stack web and mobile application development. 

I work as a student software developer with an OSU organization called [EPICLab](https://epiclab.github.io/). I am mentored by [Dr. Anita Sarma](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~sarmaa/). Currently, I am working on developing the front end of an experimental integrated development environment using TypeScript, React, Redux, and CSS. 

In my free time I enjoy participating in hackathons with my friends, building fun games, and hiking. Feel free to check out some of my work in the projects section below!
