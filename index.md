# About Me
Hi! My name is Jett Seale. Check out my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_yX7J7r7JRPsdbts7Y6QcIfE2KVaefJ/view?usp=sharing). 

### Summary
I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Oregon State University. I'm interested in full stack web and mobile application development. 

I work as a student software developer with an OSU organization called [EPICLab](https://epiclab.github.io/). I am mentored by [Dr. Anita Sarma](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~sarmaa/). Currently, I am working on developing the front end of an experimental integrated development environment using TypeScript, React, Redux, and CSS. 

In my free time I enjoy participating in hackathons with my friends, building fun games, hiking, and learning Japanese. Feel free to check out some of my work in the projects section below!

# Projects
### Synectic
Tools/technologies used: TypeScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Webpack, Electron, HTML, CSS, Jest, Enzyme, and React Testing Library.\
Synectic is an experimental integrated development environment Electron application. I developed multiple integral front-end system components, including a "create new card" modal and a file explorer. 

### Amazon Alexa Study Buddy
Tools/technologies used: JavaScript, React, AWS, Amazon Alexa, HTML, CSS.\
Amazon Alexa Study Buddy is a web application that allows the user to create their own custom flashcards. It then can connect to an Amazon Alexa to quiz the user out-loud, using the flashcards they entered on the site. I developed the entire front-end of the website, as well as assisted in programming the Amazon Alexa. 

### 3D Platformer Game
Tools/technologies used: Python and Godot.\
In my free time, I developed a 3D platformer game similar to Super Monkey Ball. Players can tilt various 3D platforms to try and roll a ball into the goal without the ball falling off the edges. I created all the assets, designed the levels, and programmed the game myself.
